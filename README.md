## Vision

The goal of this project is to build a decentralized gaming platform that rewards players with fungible tokens and unique NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) for their in-game achievements. This system integrates a token economy and collectible assets to enhance player engagement and provide a seamless gaming experience.

## Flowchart

1. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy `GameToken` contract to manage in-game currency.
   - Deploy `GameNFT` contract to manage unique game assets.
   - Deploy `GamingPlatform` contract with addresses of `GameToken` and `GameNFT`.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - A player interacts with the `GamingPlatform` by calling the `playGame()` function.
   - The platform mints 100 tokens and 1 NFT for the player.
   - Emits `RewardClaimed` event with reward details.
